## Donating to the Streamlink Project

query-streamlink owes its existence to the Streamlink project. To support their ongoing development, consider making a donation on their [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/streamlink).

## How It Works

The functioning of query-streamlink relies on making requests to Streamlink based on the URL provided by the user. It then retrieves a response containing a URL that can be used by most popular media players. This program acts as a bridge between the end user and Streamlink, ensuring smooth streaming experiences.

## Legality

query-streamlink is a legal program, as its purpose is to serve as a bridge to [Streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink). The only unlawful use would be if it were employed for malicious purposes, which in that case I can't be held responsible.

### Supported Websites

query-streamlink supports a wide range of websites compatible with [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/plugin_matrix.html). However, please be cautious of potential geolocation issues with certain services.

## Query Parameters

- `url` (required): The URL of the stream for which you need the link.
- `no_redirect` (optional, default : null) : If you do not need to be redirected into the website stream.
- `quality` (optional, default : best) : If you need a specific quality setting.

## Local Deployment
